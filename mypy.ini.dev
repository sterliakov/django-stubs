# Configuration file to use during development

# Changes of plugin code are not detected by mypy, so
# incremental mode can be harmful during development
# (mypy cache is not always invalidated).
# However, incremental mode has to be supported by django-stubs,
# thus another config (mypy.ini) is used in CI.
# Incremental mode is recommended for regular usage.

# WARNING: when changing this file, consider doing the same with mypy.ini
